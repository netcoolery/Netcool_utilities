This repository holds various utilities I have authored to help me with tasks related to the deployment and maintenance of various Netcool products.   For those who are unfamiliar with the term, "Netcool" is a brand name for a series of network and system management products, originally sold by Micromuse Ltd and now sold by IBM which wholly acquired Micromuse in 2006.

The oldest and most notable Netcool product is Netcool/OMNIbus - an event management product that was the original Micromuse product.   Often the term "Netcool" is used when the speaker is really referring to OMNIbus.

I was one of the initial five people certified in Netcool/OMNIbus and have worked with OMNIbus and other Netcool products since 1997 - first as a Micromuse partner, then from 2000 on as a Micromuse and now IBM employee.   I have worked in pre-sales, development, and post-sales consulting.
