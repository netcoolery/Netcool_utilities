<p>Imagine, if you will, the cyberspace equivalent of a modest room with a circle of chairs in the center.&nbsp; The chairs are occupied by a variety of technical types, brought together to this support group because they share the same problem.&nbsp; Yours Truly, gets up, faces his peers and says:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><p>&quot;Hi.&nbsp; My name is Roger Powell and I am an Information Hoarder. &nbsp; I work with the Netcool/OMNIbus and Tivoli Network Manager products, and I&#39;ve got lots of helpful tidbits of information, various utilities, and plenty of experience that I&#39;ve been meaning to share ... BUT ... I don&#39;t share anything unless it&#39;s perfect!&nbsp;&nbsp; If I&#39;ve written a utility script, it has to be clean and general purpose with help text.&nbsp; If I decide to respond to a question on the International User&#39;s Group mailing list, my answer must be 100% correct as if the voice of God himself (or at least Alex Greenbank) had spoken.&nbsp; Because of this, I&#39;ve likely deprived people of the chance to profit from my experience.&quot;<br />
&nbsp;</p></div>

<p>At this point in my imaginary scenario, all my peers offer encouragement and tell me that they value me as a person even if I am an Information Hoarder.&nbsp; The imaginary group leader though, prescribes what he thinks is the perfect remedy:&nbsp; &quot;You need to blog!&quot;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Um yeah - active imagination indeed!&nbsp; So this perfectionist stands before you (or whatever the cyberspace equivalent is) and expressly disavows perfection.&nbsp; I will not wait to make stuff &quot;exactly right&quot; before I post it.&nbsp; I&#39;ll be happy to fix errors once they are pointed out to me.&nbsp; And ... I promise that no other post on this blog will be as dull as this first one!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK - A little more housekeeping ... The blog will focus on Tivoli&#39;s Netcool/OMNIbus and Network Manager products because that&#39;s what I do for a living.&nbsp; The perspective will be from what I do now - post-sales consulting for IBM - although I&#39;ve done other things.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve worked with Netcool/OMNIbus since late 1997 (that&#39;s almost 15 years if you do the math) so I&#39;ve seen a few installations in my time. My aim is to be interesting and useful - at least for those who work with OMNIbus, the OMNIbus Web-based GUI, and ITNM.&nbsp; Everybody else should have surfed away by now!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>One final point today - If you are still reading this, you are a member of the <a href="netcoolusers.org/">INUG</a> mailing list,right?&nbsp; (That&#39;s the <b>International Netcool User&#39;s Group</b>.) &nbsp; It was formed back when the Netcool products all came from Micromuse, so it remains focused on those products as opposed to others in the Tivoli Suite.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you&#39;re not a member, get thee hence and join!&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s a great resource.</p>

<p>I should make it clear right now - I have no connection with the INUG, other than being a member.&nbsp; In turn, the INUG has no official relationship with IBM, but several IBMers do answer questions there (the aforementioned Alex Greenbank being a superstar IMO.)<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>And lastly this disclaimer:&nbsp; I am an IBM employee, however the statements in this blog are my own and do not necessarily represent the opinions or official positions of IBM.&nbsp; I&#39;m solely responsible for the content of the posts.<br />
</p>

<p>The posts should be much more fun from now on.</p>
