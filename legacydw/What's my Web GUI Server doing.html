<p dir="ltr">HT to Matt Lush for this:</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not sure what version they are on, but as of Web GUI 7.3.1 there is quite a lot of profiling data written to ncw.*.log files - when monitoring the Web GUI server I periodically record the following values from the log as user load is ramped up -<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Total time spent on updating the ObjectServer&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Total time spent on Event Summary Data&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Total time spent on Event Data&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Total time in the report&quot;<br />
<br />
where Event Summary Data is the refreshing dashboards usage and Event Data is the refreshing AELs usage. Usage for each individual user is also written to the log as well I think.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Matt<br />
